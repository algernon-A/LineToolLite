## So long and thanks for all the fish!
With the launch of Paradox Mods and the addition of official modding support to Cities: Skylines 2, the time for this experimental version of the Line Tool mod has now come to a close.

Simply put, this is now deprecated, and probably doesn't even work any more.

This mod has been replaced by the full version of Line Tool, which is [available now on Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/75816/Windows).
